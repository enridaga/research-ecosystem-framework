# Install (macOS)

Using [Homebrew][brew]:

    brew install eddieantonio/eddieantonio/ocreval

[brew]: http://brew.sh/


Building
========

To build the library and all of the programs, ensure that you have all
required [dependencies](#dependencies).

## Dependencies

`ocreval` requires [utf8proc](https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc)
to build from source.

### macOS

Using [Homebrew][brew]:

    brew install utf8proc

### Ubuntu/Debian

You may need to install `make` and a C compiler:

    sudo apt install build-essential

Then install, `libutf8proc-dev`:

    sudo apt install libutf8proc-dev

If `libutf8proc-dev` cannot be installed using `apt`, follow
[Other Linux](#other-linux) below

### Other Linux

Install `libutf8proc-dev` manually:

    curl -OL https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc/archive/v1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar xzf v1.3.1.tar.gz
    cd utf8proc-1.3.1/
    make
    sudo make install
    # Rebuild the shared object cache - needed to load the library
    # at runtime <http://linux.die.net/man/8/ldconfig>
    sudo ldconfig
    cd -

## Building the tools

Once all dependencies are installed, you may compile all of the
utilities using `make`:

    make

## Installing

Install to `/usr/local/`:

    sudo make install

Note: You will not need `sudo` on macOS if you have `brew` installed.

## Installing "locally"

This will not copy any files at all, but instead create the appropriate
shell commands to add all executables, man pages, and libraries to
the correct path (replace `~/.bashrc` with your start-up file):

    make exports >> ~/.bashrc
