# Work Package #1: Pilots and Web portal
WP1 coordinates Pilots development and delivers a registry of all resources and materials retrieved, used and produced in the project, in the form of a unified Web portal. Its goal is twofold: 1) to demonstrate that the methods and tools developed in the “technology provider” work packages (WP2-5) are effective in facilitating management of large musical heritage collections and supporting enhanced understanding, preservation of, and interaction with, musical heritage, 2) to contribute to push the state of the art in relevant, though specific, musical heritage use cases.
