description: "Musical Heritage Knowledge Extraction from text"
--- 
WP4 develops methods and tools for 1) creating plurilingual corpora focused on musical heritage, 2) extracting (automatically) relevant knowledge from text such as people, places, time, music works, experiences, stories, events, etc. about musical heritage, 3) evaluating knowledge extraction tools against the manually curated corpora. The developed methodologies and tools will enable the processing of multilingual textual sources, which express diverse perspectives at different times: linguistic, historical, cultural, political, etc.
