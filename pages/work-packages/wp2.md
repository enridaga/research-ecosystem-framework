WP2 develops ontology-based knowledge graphs for representing music collections (symbolic notation/scores, code-based musical assets, annotated audio/transcriptions, metadata) and the its historical, cultural, and social context.
It is also in charge of supporting the formalisation of patterns analysed in WP3 and text relations extracted in WP4. It relies on Web standards for data and knowledge representation (RDF, OWL).
