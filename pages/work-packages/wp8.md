WP8 is dedicated to providing an ethical viewpoint to the research and development activities of the project and ensuring that all pilot applications as well as the ecosystem tools have a common general goal: to improve the accessibility and availability of musical heritage knowledge on the web, in a FAIR, transparent, and ethical way.
Specifically, it establishes an ethical protocol for ensuring that all Polifonia tools and applications comply with the ethical principles for trustworthy AI.
