# Work Package #3: Mining Musical Patterns
Relying on the results of WP2, the overall goal of WP3 is to devise approaches to analysing large repositories of music (tunes, songs, etc.) to identify common, meaningful patterns that are indicative of their identity, filiation or cultural association (genres, origin, etc).
