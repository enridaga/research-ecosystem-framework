# CHILD: Music experience in childhood
This pilot will build a knowledge graph of the historical experience of music in childhood, using life writing (letters, diaries, memoirs, travel writing) and other historical texts as sources for adult reflections on music heard in childhood, third-party observations on children’s engagement with music, and children’s own first-hand accounts.
