The history of pipe organs is rich and diverse, and highly interrelated to economic, religious and artistic contexts. Currently, the information about building practices and characteristics of ~2000 Dutch pipe organs is only retrievable by manually paging a 15 volumes (4,500+ pages) encyclopaedia: the Orgelencyclopedie (1997-2010). This pilot will extract a knowledge graph out of the text of the Orgelencyclopedie, which will provide digital (and quick) access to such huge and detailed knowledge, including connection to data about aspects of their wider historic contexts.
