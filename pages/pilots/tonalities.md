Tonalities is developing tools for the modal-tonal identification, exploration and classification of monophonic and polyphonic notated music from the Renaissance to the 20th century. The pilot has a broader societal and pedagogical dimension: it does not only impact research on the theory and evolution of the musical language but is also relevant for the understanding of music collections by students, performers, and informed music lovers.
