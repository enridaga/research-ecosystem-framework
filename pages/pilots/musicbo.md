In 2006 Bologna was declared by Unesco “City of Music”. Despite this, the extraordinary musical heritage of this city is kept in cultural institutions and archives, studied by a few specialized scholars only and unknown to the many.  The overall objective of this pilot is to make Bologna’s musical heritage available and accessible to the wide public, including scholars of European music, but also music enthusiasts, students, cultural tourists, creative industries and citizens.
